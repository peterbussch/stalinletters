            <p>One of the things which marked-up xml documents enable for the end user is a rich set
                of data which can be explored in all manner of ways. Our project has seval goals.
                The first goal is to create a website where enthusiasts can easily engage with the
                corpus of letters between Stalin and Molotov in a readable and intuitive manner. Our
                second goal is to utilize the information derived from our markup of the corpus to
                draw historical conclusions which could augment a traditional investigation of tne
                Stalin era. We made note of the various locations, policies, and people who Stalin
                wrote about in order to obtain statistical information to bolster our historical
                analysis. As the time period of the corresponse rougly corresponds to the tine in
                which Stalin consolidated his power in the Sovet Union, the document corpus is
                illumaniting for the student of Stalinism and Soviet history writ large.</p>

                Throughout the letters, Stalin comes across as someone who is meticulously

                artlce published in <em>Pravda</em> or holdup in steel production, he is very aware.
                This hawkish view of the Soviet Union leads Stalin at various times to denouce,

                    <br /><br /> It is hard to overstate the vastness of the Soviet Union. Soviet
                    power stretched from the temperate Black Sea climate, winding through the
                    Ukrainian region into the heart of European Russia, extending itself along the
                    expanse of Asia to reach the Pacific Ocean and border Japan. Much before the
                    time of Stalin, Tsars and their ministers grappled with the problems of overland
                    empire, forging solutions such as the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Many of these
                    projects were successes for commerce but became a source of humiliation when the
                    Russians lost territory to Japan (an upstart power) in the Russo-Japanese War of
                    1905.<br /> The role of the <strong>place</strong> in the Stalin-Molotov
                    correspondence is an important one, suggestive of priorities in Stalin's view of
                    the USSR and the world around it. We see, of course, mentions of cities and
                    regions within the Soviet Union, including references to autonomous republics
                    within the federal structure. Especially important to Stalin are the regions
                    associated with his primary policy agendas: industrial hubs, urban centers,
                    sites of agricultural output. However, it is impossible to deny that Stalin had
                    his eyes abroad in many of these letters. This is supported by the data which
                    was extracted from the documents.</p>

                <p> Digital methods, particularly the linking of various digital tools at the
                    disposal of a modern researcher, enables a whole new world of statistical
                    analytics. There are a lot that we as students can gain from employing digital
                    methods in conjunction. For example, the example above shows the initial markup
                    of the corpus set the stage for our research avenues.</p>

                    <p>The Soviet Union was dominated by variou agencies of control which sought to
                        regulate a societ aimed towards socialism. Even as Stalin made effective use
                        of the various bureaucracis under his common through vigorous leadership, it
                        is impossible to deny that Soviet agencies, with their lack of constructive
                        communication, retarded the development of the emerging socialist state.
                        However, for a system that exchewed western methods of ascertaining
                        expertise, government agencies become sought-after employment amongst the
                        Sovet citizenry. Especially with the advent of Brezhnev era, with its perks
                        for employees of state agencies, most turned towards working for the state
                        in some capacity</p>

                    <p>As a Marxist-Leninst state firmly committed to its ideolody in the face of
                        the "captilist powers" which the USSR believed to their enemies through
                        their interpretation of history, I was expecting to find high levels of
                        ideological discussion within the corresponse of Stalin to Molotov, but
                        there was not as much in that area as I expected. Certainly one encounters
                        the Marxist interpretation of history in explications of what is happening
                        in the West (or the prudence of the collectivation policy) but that is not
                        necessarily the case. What we find in Stalin is an effective adminstrator,
                        one who is concerned with the successful completion of industrialization and
                        an understanding of world politics. <a href="ideology.html" download="Mentions of ideology">Click here to

                <p>In the years leading up to the 1917 Revolution, there were many years of
                    productive and economic growth, largely driven through investments of foreign
                    capital as well as a liberalizing administration. However, high levels of growth
                    were only sustainable until the outbreak of World War I, which sealed the fate
                    of the Romanov dynasty. After Nicholas II abdicated, the progressive Provincial
                    Government attempted to implement a series of economic liberalizations. Their
                    efforts were rendered useless by their continued support for an unpopular war
                    and the rise of social movements of all kinds. With that background in place, we
                    move on to the role of policy in the USSR. Whether one thinks of
                    collectivization or socially engineered salaries, played an integral part in the
                    Soviet system. Stalin, like his predecessor Lenin, believed that the key to
                    Soviet independence was the establishment of massive industrial power. However,
                    you can take a peek at the chart below to judge for yourself.</p>
                <img src="policy-pie-chart.svg" alt="Pie Chart of Policy Themes"
                    style="height: 550px;
                    width: 800px;" />
                <p> In tagging "policy" within the document, we had to employ a relatively liberal
                    method. For example, mentions of factory construction is tagged as policy due to
                    the heavy state involvement and coersion within enterprise. Readers with an
                    understanding of the history of Stalin's rule will not be surprised by the heavy
                    focus on collective farms (колхозы) and the industry (заводов) which came with
                    the end of the NEP period. It remains important to remember that this is not a
                    true sample of Stalin's letters, merely those sent to one trusted deputy over
                    the years. But nonetheless, it is remarkable the extent to which matters of
                    practical policy, construction, and trade are overseen by Stalin.<br />

                <p>Publications, as one would likely imagine, were particularly limited in the
                    Soviet Union. Discourse on the public stage, to the extent where it did exist,
                    was often conducted through official channels or magazines lie <em>Pravda</em>
                    or <em>Komsomolsya</em>. Since publication was so centralized, a commom theme in
                    Stalin's letters is discussion of articles in the newspapers which Stalin
                    vehemently disagrees with, For example, as time progresses, we see specific
                    instances of criticism of Bukharin and Trotsky appear.</p>
